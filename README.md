# Custom HTML5 Video Player

* I became acquainted with the ShadowDOM when I made my video player go full screen. That infernal Shadow DOM. But it's very important and useful to get to know for such situations as I encountered. Check out this project on JavaScript30 to find out what I am talking about, and then dig deep into the Shadow DOM!

* Make your video player look more like a Youtube or Netflix experience instead of a user agent stylesheet!
